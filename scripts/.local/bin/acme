# First, we start the plumber file server in the background, we then start the
# acme editor. Note that we use the absolute path of acme to avoid this script
# calling itself recursively. Then, after the acme editing session comes to an
# end, we kill the plumber process. The whole output is directed to /dev/null to
# avoid anything being echoed on the terminal.
